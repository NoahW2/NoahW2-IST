    <p> I was born in Manhattan, and have lived in Brooklyn my entire life.
        <br> I attend Newhouse at Syracuse University, where I study broadcast and digital journalism.
        <br> While I am unsure about what I would like to do in my professional future, hockey is my largest passion.
        <br> I have played ice hockey since the age of five, and currently I'm on Syracuse University's roller hockey team.
        <br> I would love to be involved with hockey in some capacity in my professional future.
